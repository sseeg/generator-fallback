# Fallback generator

> A Yeoman generator to set up a web app using Fallback and Bower for dependencies

## Usage

The generator is not currently ready to be used, I am pusing it to Github to better track my development. If you still want to use it, you may use `git clone` to clone the repo to a folder in your computer, then use `npm link` to create a symlink from your global modules to the local folder. Then run `yo fallback` to run the generator, even though it won't do anything but ask you questions yet.

## Todo

My first priority (of course) is to get the generator working, and able to generate a project with Fallback. The next priority will be adding unit testing for the generator.
